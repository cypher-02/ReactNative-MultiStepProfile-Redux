# ReactNative-MultiStepProfile-Redux
A React Native application built with TypeScript and Redux Toolkit that implements a multi-step user profile form. The app allows users to create, view, and delete profiles using Redux-managed state and React Navigation for screen flow. No backend is used, ensuring a fully local and self-contained application.
